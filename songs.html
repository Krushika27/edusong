  <h2>The New Periodic Table Song</h2>
  <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Chemistry</p>

  <pre>
There's Hydrogen and Helium Then Lithium, Baryllium
Boron, Carbon everywhere Nitrogen all through the air
With Oxygen so you can breathe
And Fluorine for your pretty teeth
Neon to light up the signs
Sodium for salty times
Magnesium, Aluminium, Silicon, Phosphorus
Then Sulphur, Chlorine And Argon
Potassium and Calcium, so you'll grow strong
Scandium, Titanium, Vanadium And Chromium and Manganese
This is the Periodic Table
Noble Gas is stable
Halogens and Alkali react aggressively
Each period we'll see new outer shells
While electrons are added moving to the right
Iron is the 26, then Cobalt Nickel, coins you get
Copper, Zinc, and Gallium Germanium and Arsenic
Selenium and Bromine film While Krypton helps light up your room
Rubidium and Strontium Then Yttrium, Zirconium Niobium, Molybdenum, Technetium
Ruthenium, Rhodium, Palladium
Silver-ware, then Cadmium and Indium
Tin-cans, Antimony, then Tellurium
And Iodine and Xenon, and then Caesium
And Barium is 56, and this is where the table splits
Where lanthanides have just begun
Lanthanum, Cerium and Praseodymium
Neodymium's next to Promethium, then 62
Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium, and Terbium
Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium Hafnium, Tantalum, Tungsten
Then we're on to Rhenium, Osmium, and Iridium
Platinum, Gold to make you rich till you grow old
Mercury to tell you when it's really cold
Thallium and Lead, then Bismuth for your tummy
Polonium, Astatine would not be yummy
Radon, Francium will last a little time
Radium, then Actinides at 89
This is the Periodic Table
Noble Gas is stable
Halogens and Alkali react aggressively
Each period we'll see new outer shells
While electrons are to right
Actinium, Thorium, Protactinium
Uranium, Neptunium, Plutonium
Americium, Cerium, Brekelium, Californium
Einsteinium, Fermium, Mendelevium, Nobelium
Lawrencium, Rutherfordium, Dubnium, Seaborgium
Bohrium, Hassium, then Meinerium, Darmstadtium
Roentgenium, Copernicium
Ununtrium, Flerovium
Ununpentium, Livermorium
Ununseptium, Ununoctium
And then we're done
