  <h2>The New Periodic Table Song</h2>
  <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Chemistry</p>

  <pre>
There's Hydrogen and Helium Then Lithium, Baryllium
Boron, Carbon everywhere Nitrogen all through the air
With Oxygen so you can breathe
And Fluorine for your pretty teeth
Neon to light up the signs
Sodium for salty times
Magnesium, Aluminium, Silicon, Phosphorus
Then Sulphur, Chlorine And Argon
Potassium and Calcium, so you'll grow strong
Scandium, Titanium, Vanadium And Chromium and Manganese
This is the Periodic Table
Noble Gas is stable
Halogens and Alkali react aggressively
Each period we'll see new outer shells
While electrons are added moving to the right
Iron is the 26, then Cobalt Nickel, coins you get
Copper, Zinc, and Gallium Germanium and Arsenic
Selenium and Bromine film While Krypton helps light up your room
Rubidium and Strontium Then Yttrium, Zirconium Niobium, Molybdenum, Technetium
Ruthenium, Rhodium, Palladium
Silver-ware, then Cadmium and Indium
Tin-cans, Antimony, then Tellurium
And Iodine and Xenon, and then Caesium
And Barium is 56, and this is where the table splits
Where lanthanides have just begun
Lanthanum, Cerium and Praseodymium
Neodymium's next to Promethium, then 62
Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium, and Terbium
Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium Hafnium, Tantalum, Tungsten
Then we're on to Rhenium, Osmium, and Iridium
Platinum, Gold to make you rich till you grow old
Mercury to tell you when it's really cold
Thallium and Lead, then Bismuth for your tummy
Polonium, Astatine would not be yummy
Radon, Francium will last a little time
Radium, then Actinides at 89
This is the Periodic Table
Noble Gas is stable
Halogens and Alkali react aggressively
Each period we'll see new outer shells
While electrons are to right
Actinium, Thorium, Protactinium
Uranium, Neptunium, Plutonium
Americium, Cerium, Brekelium, Californium
Einsteinium, Fermium, Mendelevium, Nobelium
Lawrencium, Rutherfordium, Dubnium, Seaborgium
Bohrium, Hassium, then Meinerium, Darmstadtium
Roentgenium, Copernicium
Ununtrium, Flerovium
Ununpentium, Livermorium
Ununseptium, Ununoctium
And then we're done

  <h2>TRIGONOMETRIC Song</h2>
  <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Trigonometry </p>

  <pre>
Sin theta, opposite by hypotenuse
Cos theta, Adjacent by hypotenuse
Tan theta, opposite by adjacent side
This is called trigonometry
Cosec theta, equals one by Sin theta
Secant theta, equals one by Cos theta
Cot theta equals, one by Tan theta
Together we are Trigonometric Ratios
Tan theta equals Sin theta by Cos theta
Cot theta equals Cos theta by Sin theta
Quotient Identities of Trigonometry
And we will drive you Confused & Crazy ~
We are branch of Mathematics
Relating Sides & Angles of Right Triangles
Repeat ^⁠_⁠^
Sin theta, opposite by hypotenuse
Cos theta, Adjacent by hypotenuse
Tan theta, opposite by adjacent side
This is called trigonometry
aahahaa~
(^⁠_⁠^)
We made learning easy
Trigonometry, LaLaLa~
Oh Oh
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Oh Oh Oh
Trigonometry LaLaLa

  <h2>The Geography Song</h2>
  <p><strong>Subject:</strong> geography </p>

  <pre>
If you're looking at a globe or a map of the world And you wanna understand it you gotta know these:
Hemisphere, North & South Poles, Equator, Oceans, Continents, and lots and lots of Countries!
The real world is round, and shaped like a sphere And divided into East and West Hemispheres The real world is round, and shaped like a sphere And divided into East and West Hemispheres
On the top and bottom, where it's always cold Are two points we call the North and South Poles On the top and the bottom, where it's always cold Are two points we call the North and South Poles
And in between the poles, yes right in the centre Is an imaginary line we call the Equator! In between the poles, yes right in the centre Is an imaginary line we call the Equator!
If you're looking at a globe or a map of the world And you wanna understand it you gotta know these:
Hemispheres, North & South Poles, Equator, Oceans, Continents, and lots and lots of Countries!
The world is mostly water, I'll say it again:
The world is mostly water, filled with Oceans!
Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Indian Ocean
Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean 
But there is also land so please don't forget it's divided into seven Continents:
North & South America, Europe & Africa, Asia, Australia and Antarctica 
In the continents it's divided again into many different countries also called Nations. Now how many countries? - have you ever wondered? Count them all up its almost two hundred! almost two hundred countries!
SING IT ONE MORE TIME 
If you're looking at a globe or a map of the world And you wanna understand it you gotta know these:
Hemispheres, North & South Poles, Equator, Oceans, Continents, and lots and lots of Countries!
